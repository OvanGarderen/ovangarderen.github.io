My main research area is the part of enumerative algebraic geometry called refined Donaldson--Thomas theory, which is concerned with counting sheaves on complex threefolds. To compute these sheaf counts one has to understand various moduli spaces, which are often quite complicated beasts.

There are various tools one can use to study the moduli spaces appearing in DT theory. The ones I care about are:

- stability conditions, which breaks down moduli spaces into more manageable strata,
- tilting theory, which relates moduli spaces of sheaves to moduli spaces of quivers,
- deformation theory, which expresses the local geometry of the space using homological algebra

The main goal of my research is to make new contributions in these areas, in order to advance our understanding of enumerative geometry. In particular, I am looking to develop techniques that work in noncompact settings, which would allow us to reason about moduli spaces and their invariants using local arguments. Typical examples of such noncompact spaces are crepant resolutions of singularities appearing in the threefold minimal model program, which I studied during my PhD and afterwards.
