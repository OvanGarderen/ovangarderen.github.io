I am assegno di ricerca (postdoc) in the algebraic geometry group of SISSA Trieste.

I got my PhD at the University of Glasgow in 2021 under the supervision of Michael Wemyss and Ben Davison. In 2021/2022 I was a guest researcher at the Max-Planck institute in Bonn. After that I spent two years at the University of Luxembourg in the research group of Sarah Scherotzke and Pieter Belmans.

My research centers on the interaction between enumerative geometry and representation theory. I am interested in enumerative invariants, moduli spaces of quivers, Hall algebras, deformation theory, derived categories, A-infinity algebras, among many other things.
