@misc{2409.05605v1,
	abstract = {The knots-quivers correspondence is a relation between knot invariants and enumerative invariants of quivers, which in particular translates the knot operations of linking and unlinking to a certain mutation operation on quivers. In this paper we show that the moduli spaces of a quiver and its linking/unlinking are naturally related, giving a purely representation theoretic interpretation of these operations. We obtain a relation between the cohomologies of these spaces which is moreover compatible with a natural action of the Cohomological Hall Algebra. The result is a categorification of quiver linking/unlinking at the level of CoHA modules.},

@misc{2207.13540v1,
	abstract = {This paper shows that the motivic BPS invariants associated to a noncommutative crepant resolution of a compound Du-Val singularity are controlled by the labelled Dynkin combinatorics appearing in the work of Iyama–Wemyss. In particular, we show that the invariants vanish for dimension vectors which are not a multiple of a restricted root obtained from the affine root system under a natural quotient map. An immediate corollary is a description of the curve classes for which the Gopakumar–Vafa invariants of geometric crepant resolutions vanish, generalising a recent result of Nabijou–Wemyss to the nonisolated setting. We furthermore formulate a method for finding symmetries among the non-vanishing invariants using derived equivalences, and show how this can be applied to line bundle twists and mutation functors in some settings. In particular, we find new wall-crossing relations among the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the different crepant resolutions of a cDV singularity.},

@article{CycAinf,
	abstract = {This paper considers $A\_\infty$-algebras whose higher products satisfy an analytic bound with respect to a fixed norm. We define a notion of right Calabi–Yau structures on such $A\_\infty$-algebras and show that these give rise to cyclic minimal models satisfying the same analytic bound. This strengthens a theorem of Kontsevich–Soibelman, and yields a flexible method for obtaining analytic potentials of Hua-Keller.
  We apply these results to the endomorphism DGAs of polystable sheaves considered by Toda, for which we construct a family of such right CY structures obtained from analytic germs of holomorphic volume forms on a projective variety. As a result, we can define a canonical cyclic analytic $A\_\infty$-structure on the Ext-algebra of a polystable sheaf, which depends only on the analytic-local geometry of its support. This shows that the results of Toda can be extended to the quasi-projective setting, and yields a new method for comparing cyclic $A\_\infty$-structures of sheaves on different Calabi–Yau varieties.},

@misc{2008.02591v2,
	abstract = {We develop theoretical aspects of refined Donaldson-Thomas theory for threefold flops, and use these to determine all DT invariants for a doubly infinite family of length 2 flopping contractions. Our results show that a refined version of the strong-rationality conjecture of Pandharipande-Thomas holds in this setting, and also that refined DT invariants do not classify flops. Our main innovation is the application of tilting theory to better understand the stability conditions and cyclic A-infinity-deformation theory of these spaces. Where possible we work in the motivic setting, but we also compute intermediary refinements, such as mixed Hodge structures.},

@article{BBvG25,
	abstract = {There exists a dictionary between hereditary orders and smooth stacky curves, resp. tame orders of global dimension 2 and Azumaya algebras on smooth stacky surfaces. We extend this dictionary by explaining how the restriction of a tame order to a curve on the underlying surface corresponds to the fiber product of the curve with the stacky surface. By considering "bad" intersections we can start extending the dictionary in the 1-dimensional case to include non-hereditary orders and singular stacky curves. Two applications of these results are a novel description and classification of noncommutative conics in graded Clifford algebras, giving a geometric proof of results of Hu-Matsuno-Mori, and a complete understanding and classification of skew cubics, generalizing the work of Kanazawa for Fermat skew cubics.},
